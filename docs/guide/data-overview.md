Data and widgets for it
=======================

One of the most powerful aspects of Yii is how it works with data. One may output data directly and that's a good approach
for website frontend but when it comes to backend data components and widgets may save you weeks.

Typically, you would take the following steps when working with one of these data components:

1. Configure data provider. It may take its data from array, SQL, AR query etc.
2. Pass data provider to one of the widgets such as list view or grid view.
3. Customize the widget to reflect the presentational style that you are after.

That's it. After doing these simple steps you can get a full featured data grid supporting pagination, sorting and
filtering that is ideal for admin part of your project.
